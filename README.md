Ahoy sailor! The Sea Words is a website where you can search, add and even edit nautical terms.


### UX
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
### First Time User
- As a first time user, I want the function of the site to be obvious.
- As a first time user, I want to be able to search.
- As a first time user, I want the process whereby I can add my own entry to be obvious.
- As a first time user, I want the option to sign up and add my own listing. 

### Regular User
- As a regular user, I want to option to edit any entry I see as inaccurate.
- As a regular user, I want assurance that my enteries cannot be deleted by bad actors.
- As a regular user, I want the abilty to search for entries. 
- As a regular user, I want the ability to see whom entries have been added by.
- As a regular user, I want it to be immediately obvious upon visiting the site whether I am logged in or not.

*   ### Design

    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The main colours used are Blue (#) and white, in-keeping with the nautical theme. 
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Bodoni Moda font is the main font used in the game. This font was chosen for its 'classical' look which reflects the historical nature of the site. 
    -   #### Imagery
        -   The rope coil background image was selected to tie into the natical theme of the site to visitors and users. 
    -   #### Layout

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Search function:
    1. Go to the Home page
    2. Try to submit the empty search and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the search with less than 3 letters verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the search with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
